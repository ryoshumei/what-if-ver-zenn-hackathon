# Feature Specification: Hackathon AI Agent Web App ‚Äî ‚ÄúWhat If‚Äù Idea Visualizer

**Feature Branch**: `001-hackathon-ai-agent`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Hackathon AI agent web app to visualize 'what if' ideas as images or videos, enabling users to input short descriptions and share results. Prioritize excellent UX and ensure generated media faithfully expresses user intent. Concept: 'what if' ‚Äî e.g., chairs float when a vacuum robot arrives; escalators on pedestrian bridge stairs; a robot that changes bedsheets. The app should help turn small everyday ideas into tangible visuals as a first step toward reality."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a creator with a spark of a "what if" idea, I want to enter a short natural-language description and receive a faithful visual (image or short video) that embodies my intent, so that I can quickly assess and share the idea with others.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a descriptive "what if" text in a supported language, **When** I select "Image" and click Generate, **Then** I see a single image that matches the key semantics of my prompt and can refine, regenerate, download, or share it.
2. **Given** a descriptive "what if" text in a supported language, **When** I select "Video" and click Generate, **Then** I see a short clip that visually represents the core idea (objects, actions, setting). If video generation is unavailable, the system offers an image fallback with a clear explanation.
3. **Given** I have generated a visual, **When** I click Refine and add guidance (e.g., style, specific objects, motion), **Then** a new result is produced that more closely aligns with my intent, and differences from the previous result are easy to compare.
4. **Given** my visual represents my idea accurately, **When** I publish it as Public, **Then** it appears in the community feed with my prompt, thumbnail/preview, and creator attribution, respecting content policies.
5. **Given** my prompt is too short, empty, or unclear, **When** I click Generate, **Then** inline validation explains the issue and suggests how to improve the prompt (examples, minimum detail).
6. **Given** my prompt violates content policy, **When** I attempt to generate, **Then** the system blocks the request and shows a clear, user-friendly reason and guidance.
7. **Given** generation fails due to system error or overload, **When** I retry, **Then** the system communicates status, provides an ETA or queueing, and preserves my input without loss.

### Edge Cases
- Ambiguous prompts (e.g., "make it better") without concrete nouns/verbs
- Extremely long prompts exceeding limits; truncation vs guidance
- Non-supported languages; mixed-language prompts
- High traffic periods causing queuing or degraded latency
- Content policy violations (unsafe content)
- Accessibility needs: alt text for images; captions for videos
- Users without accounts trying to share or save
- Network interruptions during generation or upload
- Very large outputs or long videos; timeouts and partial results

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow users to enter a natural-language "what if" description.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST let users choose output mode: Image or Video.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST validate prompts and provide actionable guidance for vague or empty inputs.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST generate a visual that reflects the core entities and actions in the prompt.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide refinement flows (edit prompt, add guidance, regenerate) without losing history.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST enable saving results to a personal space and optionally publishing to a public gallery.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST provide a community feed listing public ideas with thumbnails/previews and prompts.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST allow users to manage visibility (Private, Unlisted, Public) for each idea/visual.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST enforce content policies and communicate rejections clearly.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST support basic discovery (search by keywords/tags) for public ideas.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST capture lightweight feedback (e.g., "matches my intent" yes/no, optional note) to improve alignment.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST provide download options (image as file; video as file or link) subject to policy.
- **FR-013**: The system SHOULD provide prompt templates/examples to inspire users (e.g., floating chair, escalator bridge, sheet-changing robot).
- **FR-014**: The system SHOULD support multilingual prompts (English, Simplified Chinese, Japanese). Prompts in these languages are accepted and automatically interpreted; unsupported languages receive guidance and an English fallback option.
- **FR-015**: The system SHOULD present a simple comparison view between iterations.
- **FR-016**: The system MUST handle generation failures gracefully with retries or fallbacks and preserve user inputs.
- **FR-017**: The system MUST provide accessibility features (keyboard navigation, alt text, captions). Images require alt text (auto-suggested from the prompt with user edit); videos require captions for spoken or described content (auto-suggested in English with user edit before publishing).
- **FR-018**: The system MUST ensure that published content includes creator attribution and timestamp.
- **FR-019**: The system SHOULD support lightweight sharing links (link preview with prompt and thumbnail) respecting visibility settings.
- **FR-020**: The system SHOULD allow users to report inappropriate content in the gallery.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Usability MUST prioritize clear, low-friction interactions for first-time users (excellent UX).
- **NFR-004**: The system MUST provide clear status/progress feedback during generation.
- **NFR-005**: The system MUST comply with content and privacy policies covering: violence, sexual content, hate/harassment, self-harm, illegal activities, minors, and personal data. Public gallery MUST exclude PII and unsafe content; violations are blocked with clear messaging.
- **NFR-006**: Data retention: private prompts and outputs retained up to 30 days (user can delete anytime); public posts retained until unpublished; anonymized telemetry retained up to 90 days.

### Scope Boundaries
- Outputs: Image (single frame) or short video up to 6 seconds.
- Default image size: up to 1024√ó1024; users can refine/regenerate one variation at a time.
- Supported prompt languages: English, Simplified Chinese, Japanese; others receive guidance and fallback.
- Sharing: Publishing requires creator attribution; reported content is reviewable and removable per policy.

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- **User**: Creator/consumer of ideas; attributes: display name, profile, preferences, locale.
- **IdeaPrompt**: The textual "what if" description; attributes: text, language, tags, createdAt, updatedAt.
- **Generation**: A produced output; attributes: type (image|video), status, createdAt, sourcePromptId, refinementOf (optional), alignmentFeedback.
- **MediaAsset**: Stored visual; attributes: url/reference, format, dimensions/duration, alt/captions, visibility.
- **PolicyFlag**: Content policy signals; attributes: reason, severity, resolution.
- **CommunityPost**: Publicly shared idea; attributes: prompt summary, thumbnail/preview, authorId, publishedAt, visibility.
